# Data-Visualization-Project

This repository contains the 'Data Visualization Project' made by me.

In this project I am visualizing some data using matplotlib, pandas, and numpy in Jupyter Notebook:

STEP-1: Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/codingelements/gapminder

STEP-2: On a single graph, plotting 3 lines:

         1. India’s life expectancy (y-axis) over the years (x-axis)

         2. India’s population (y-axis) over the years (x-axis)

         3. India’s GDP per capita (y-axis) over the years (x-axis)

STEP-3: Labeling each of the 3 curves and displaying the legend.
